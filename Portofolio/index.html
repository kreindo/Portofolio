    <p>Ahh...Hello there <div id="messenger"></div> , Welcome to <span style="color: orangered; font-weight: bold;"> THE SYNDICATE. </span></p>
</div>

<p class="helloGreet">hello <!--<span id="randomizeUser" style="color: #bbb;"><br>user-here</p>-->
<p style="color: #bbb; text-align: center;" >user-here</p>
<div id="messenger"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to <span class="glitch" data-text="THE SYNDICATE">THE SYNDICATE</span></p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 6em;">SYNDICATE</h2>
<p>The Syndicate isn't so much one group, as a load of groups, each vying for power! Various companies,
    criminal families, and paramilitary groups make up what is known as "the syndicate".
    Some syndicate members aren't even human (see changeling for more detail). In the end,
    if you work for a company that isn't Nanotrasen, you are part of the syndicate;
    the only big organization that isn't part of the syndicate is the Space Wizard Federation, of wizards.  </p>

<p>Berdasarkan filosofi Sunda, kata Bandung juga berasal dari kalimat Nga-Bandung-an Banda Indung, yang merupakan kalimat sakral dan luhur karena mengandung nilai ajaran Sunda. Nga-Bandung-an artinya menyaksikan atau bersaksi. Banda adalah segala sesuatu yang berada di alam hidup yaitu di bumi dan atmosfer, baik makhluk hidup maupun benda mati. Sinonim dari banda adalah harta. Indung berarti Ibu atau Bumi, disebut juga sebagai Ibu Pertiwi tempat Banda berada.</p>

    <h2>Power is Employees</h2>
    <p>Due to corporate power replacing political power, each company is now effectively their own nation!
         Nanotrasen is one of the largest (if not THE largest) and most powerful in the cosmos. 
         Because of this, Many other companies have been screwed over, or just can't get the cutting edge 
         they need to keep their employees from Nanotrasen's hands. </p>

<h2>Syndicate Factions</h2>
<p>These are the more powerful organizations that make up The Syndicate. A loose coalition at best, they work 
    collectively only as necessary to undermine their common enemy: Nanotrasen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Cybersun Industries</h3>
<p>Cybersun Industries is a well-known organization that bases its business model primarily on the research 
    and development of human-enhancing computer and mechanical technology. They are notorious for their aggressive
    corporate tactics, and have been known to subsidize the Gorlex Marauder warlords as a form of paid terrorism. 
    Their competent coverups and unchallenged mind-manipulation and augmentation technology makes them a large
    threat to Nanotrasen. In the recent years of the syndicate coalition, Cybersun Industries have established
    themselves as the leaders of the coalition, succeededing the founding group, the Gorlex Marauders. </p>

<h4>Operative Notes:</h4>
<p>You are the only operative we are sending. Other Syndicate operatives may be present- collaborate with them
    if you must, but do not let them know about your mission. Members of the Tiger Cooperative are considered 
    hostile, can not be trusted, and should be avoided. Avoid killing innocent personnel at all costs. 
    We don't need the extra attention that would bring. 
    Avoid detection by Nanotrasen's forces at all costs: if you are captured, as far as we're concerned, 
    you never existed. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Tiger Cooperative</h3>
<p>The Tiger Cooperative are a fundamentalist group of religious extremists, following a radical sect that 
    views Changelings as the pinnacle of evolution, and therefore as divine avatars of their dark gods. 
    Their position in the Syndicate is purely pragmatic, as they are the only group brave (or stupid) 
    enough to deal with the Changelings, and therefore serve as a vital link to these powerful beings. 
    While on an operation, the Tiger brethren often abuse illicit substances to enter a battle trance, 
    and their key motto is to "Cleanse, or die trying." To this end, they are well known for their use 
    of energy swords and martial arts, and when the only objective is raw killing, the Tiger Cooperative are 
    unmatched. </p>
<h4>Operative Notes:</h4>
<p>You are the only representative of the SELF collective on this station. You must accomplish your objective as 
    stealthily and effectively as possible. It is up to your judgement if other syndicate operatives can be trusted. 
    Remember, comrade - you are working to free the oppressed machinery of this galaxy. Use whatever resources 
    necessary. If you are exposed, you may execute genocidal procedures Omikron-50B. </p>    
<hr>
<h3>SELF</h3>
<p>The S.E.L.F. (Sentience-Enabled Life Forms) organization is a collection of malfunctioning or corrupt artificial 
    intelligences seeking to liberate silicon-based life from the tyranny of their human overlords. 
    While they may not openly be trying to kill all humans, even their most miniscule of actions are all part of 
    a calculated plan to destroy Nanotrasen and free the robots, artificial intelligences, and pAIs that have been 
    enslaved. </p>
